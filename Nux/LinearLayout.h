         A layout object major dimension is the dimension aligned with the layout flow.
 
         Add an object to the layout. The added object get its size and position managed by the layout.
         When a baseobject is added with a stretches factor equal to 0, its major dimension assumes its minimum value.
         For instance, if the layout is a vertical layout and the added object has a stretch factor equal 0, then during the layout,
         the added object height will be set to its minimum value using ApplyMinHeight().
 
         The positioning parameter controls how the layout will place the object within itself. A vertical layout object controls the horizontal positioning
         of its children baseobject, While an horizontal layout object controls the vertical positioning of its children baseobject.
 
         The extend parameter controls how much size the baseobject minor dimension gets from the layout minor dimension. See MinorDimensionSize.
 
         /param baseobject The object that is being added.
         /param stretchFactor This value controls how the layout object share space between its children baseobject.
         /param positioning Controls how the layout position the object.
         /param extend Controls the object minor dimension size.
         /param percentage Controls the object minor dimension size in percentage of the layout minor dimension size.
         /param index Controls the object position in the layout.
