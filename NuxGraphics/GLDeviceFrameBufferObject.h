/*!
FramebufferObject Class. This class encapsulates the FramebufferObject
(FBO) OpenGL spec. See the official spec at:
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry/EXT/framebuffer_object.txt

for details.

A framebuffer object(FBO) is conceptually a structure containing pointers
to GPU memory. The memory pointed to is either an OpenGL texture or an
OpenGL RenderBuffer. FBOs can be used to render to one or more textures,
share depth buffers between multiple sets of color buffers/textures and
are a complete replacement for pbuffers.

Performance Notes:
1) It is more efficient(but not required) to call Bind()
on an FBO before making multiple method calls. For example:

FramebufferObject fbo;
fbo.Bind();
fbo.AttachTexture(GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0_EXT, texId0);
fbo.AttachTexture(GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT1_EXT, texId1);
fbo.IsValid();

To provide a complete encapsulation, the following usage
pattern works correctly but is less efficient:

FramebufferObject fbo;
// NOTE : No Bind() call
fbo.AttachTexture(GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0_EXT, texId0);
fbo.AttachTexture(GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT1_EXT, texId1);
fbo.IsValid();

The first usage pattern binds the FBO only once, whereas
the second usage binds/unbinds the FBO for each method call.

2) Use FramebufferObject::Disable() sparingly. We have intentionally
left out an "Unbind()" method because it is largely unnecessary
and encourages rendundant Bind/Unbind coding. Binding an FBO is
usually much faster than enabling/disabling a pbuffer, but is
still a costly operation. When switching between multiple FBOs
and a visible OpenGL framebuffer, the following usage pattern
is recommended:

FramebufferObject fbo1, fbo2;
fbo1.Bind();
... Render ...
// NOTE : No Unbind/Disable here...

fbo2.Bind();
... Render ...

// Disable FBO rendering and return to visible window
// OpenGL framebuffer.
FramebufferObject::Disable();

  Renderbuffer Class. This class encapsulates the Renderbuffer OpenGL
  object described in the FramebufferObject(FBO) OpenGL spec.
  See the official spec at:
  http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/registry/EXT/framebuffer_object.txt
  for complete details.

  A "Renderbuffer" is a chunk of GPU memory used by FramebufferObjects to
  represent "traditional" framebuffer memory(depth, stencil, and color buffers).
  By "traditional," we mean that the memory cannot be bound as a texture.
  With respect to GPU shaders, Renderbuffer memory is "write-only." Framebuffer
  operations such as alpha blending, depth test, alpha test, stencil test, etc.
  read from this memory in post-fragement-shader(ROP) operations.

  The most common use of Renderbuffers is to create depth and stencil buffers.
  Note that as of 7/1/05, NVIDIA drivers to do not support stencil Renderbuffers.

  Usage Notes:
  1) "internalFormat" can be any of the following:
  Valid OpenGL internal formats beginning with:
  RGB, RGBA, DEPTH_COMPONENT

  or a stencil buffer format(not currently supported
  in NVIDIA drivers as of 7/1/05).
  STENCIL_INDEX1_EXT
  STENCIL_INDEX4_EXT
  STENCIL_INDEX8_EXT
  STENCIL_INDEX16_EXT
