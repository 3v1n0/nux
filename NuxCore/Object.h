        Widget are typically created and added to containers. It is decided that when widgets are created, they should have a floating reference
        and their reference count is set to 1.
        {
            Button* button = new Button();  // button ref_cout = 1, floating = true;
            container->AddButton(button);   // button has a floating reference; when container call button->ref() the ref count
                                            // of button remains at 1 but the floating reference is set to false. From now on,
                                            // calling button->ref will always increase the ref count (since button no longer has a floating reference).
        }

        It is best to pair calls to ref() with unref() when it comes to widgets. So if a widget was not added to a container and so it still has a
        floating reference, then call Dispose(). Dispose does some sanity check; it verifies that:
             ref_count == 1
             floating == true
        If these conditions are verified, dispose will cause the object to be destroyed.
        Calling unref() on an object that has a floating reference will trigger a warning/error in order to invite the
        developer. The developer can either ref the object first before calling unref or simply not create the widget since it
        does not appear to have been used.

        During development it often happen that one forget to dispose an object with a floating reference.
        Assuming that all functions that receive a reference counted object properly call ref on the object and that the compiler
        can detect unused variables, then the developer should have a way to detect reference counted objects that are not owned.
        It is up to the developer to properly handle these objects.
